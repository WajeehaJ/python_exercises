Exercise 2.4:1. The volume of a sphere with radius r is 4/3 Ï€ r3.
What is the volume of a sphere with radius 5? Hint: 392.7 is wrong!
2. Suppose the cover price of a book is $24.95, but bookstores get
a 40% discount. Shipping costs $3 for the first copy and 75 cents for
each additional copy. What is the total wholesale cost for 60 copies?
3. If I leave my house at 6:52 am and run 1 mile at an easy pace
(8:15 per mile), then 3 miles at tempo (7:12 per mile)
and 1 mile at easy pace again, what time do I get home for breakfast?
